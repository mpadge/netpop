# netpop
Simluations of populations reproducing and moving throughout different kinds of
networks of 2, 3, 4, and 25 nodes.

Two nodes are theoretical values calculated with an R script; all others are C++
simulations. Three-node networks are triangular; there are four different
four-node networks; and there are two different kinds of 25-node networks:
dendritic and lattice, with their own separate routines.
